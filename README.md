# WebServer

This was the last project for CS222 - Systems Programming (2018)                                                                                                                                                                             
The idea of this project was to create a web server from scratch using C.
This project gave us experience using networking libraries in C as well as exposure to Linux to be able to run and use the binary.                                                                                                           
There is a directory that contains the html files that the server is supposed to fetch and display on the browser.                                                                                                                           
Usage:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
  After compiling, run the binary with a <port> and the directory in which the index.html file is located.
  For this specific example:
      ./server 9999 test                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  You can then go to localhost:9999 to see the website in action.
